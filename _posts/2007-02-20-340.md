Did some homework.  Read Consuming Religion. By read, I mean skimmed.  By skimmed, I mean suffered.  That book should be restricted for purchase only by theologians or something.  Now I need to write a paper.  Meh.

Why do I continue to put off my skiing agenda?  I'm going this weekend.  This electronic text shall be my witness.

My soccer prodigy self-representation in FIFA 07 is amazing.

so.....

I was messing with a few BIOS settings, because... well, I don't know why. I wanted to see if it would speed up the computer. I just changed things from 'optimal' to 'aggressive.' I think I did this under two categories. So then I go to save the changes and restart, like normal. And everything's normal. Until it wasn't anymore. The comp spins up and everything is powered, but it doens't POST at all. POSTing is what happens before the computer even boots up, a check to make sure everything is working. Nothing is being put out to the monitor.

Either my mobo or CPU is fried, I think, after surfing forums for like 4 hours and spending much more trying to reset CMOS.

boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

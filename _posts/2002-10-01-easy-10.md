yeah so Travis and I ran to school today. big whoop. it was only, what? 9 miles? piece - o - cake.

running is so much fun. you ought to try it someday.

Mr. Frank needs to ask me to name more sets so I can satisfy everyone.... that was fun today. Actually, all of rehearsal was fun. I think being surrounded by Pat, Travis, Jeremy, and Nick creates such a funny atmosphere that it is impossible not to have a fun reheasal!

English class is pointless. No point whatsoever. More on this later.

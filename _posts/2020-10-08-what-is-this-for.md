Why do I maintain this? I’ve long had aspirations of maintaining a blog for public consumption, with timely thoughtful content, maybe even as a business idea. As I look back at the posting history, it’s clear that has not happened. I suspect that the impossibly high bar that I set for myself stopped any effort to clear it! And it’s foolish to think that something is going to change to make that happen. Especially considering \*waves hands around wildly\* all this. So this post will serve as a reminder to myself about what this site is for. It’s a personal journal, a place to record my thoughts about anything and everything, with no specific timeline or search engine optimization or business goal. So there you go, Lee. Not that hard, was it?

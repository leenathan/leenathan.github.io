Lee's weekend: Thursday- Dad left for Scout thing Friday afternoon- Mom left for other Scout thing

Friday- went to Don's house (my home for the weekend) and went bowling with Xie, Ryan Bristow and Krista McKinney. I so beat everyone there. Only the computers were broken and didn't know that I was supposed to be winning. Drove around like loonies, DIDN'T see Jessica, Juana, and Erin at Sonic, and then went to Ryan's house and watched some of shibby. and den me and don went home and played Monopoly and stuff. I ended up losing after giving lotsa cash money to Don with his hotels on Tennessee and New York. eh. sleep at 2, woke up, UIL meet, blah. blah blah. Picked up Katy, went to see Ice Age, saw the line at the pink theater, so we went to the mall and saw ET. If we had been 10 years younger, it would've been better. Saw John, Zack, etc afterwards, and decided to camp out for Star Wars tickets when it comes out in May. ooooooooo Star Wars. and den we went back home, played hide and seek with katy, and played Monopoly. I was winning until Don got Free Parking (HUGE) and I threw in the towel. zzzzzzz church (which consisted of me and Don getting tired of having no donuts ((Where's Mr. Van Bebber?)) and leaving church to go to Albertson's and get Krispy Kremes) , more Katy with a 2-year old and Easter Eggs, and then 15 minutes of physics.

If you don't want to read the above paragraph, read this:

I LOVE KATY

They lived happily ever after. The end.

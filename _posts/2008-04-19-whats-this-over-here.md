I'm trapped inside. Winter doesn't want to leave without one last cold spell. I think the temperature is supposed to hit the balmy mid 40s today, but still, there is snow in the forecast. Silly Pacific weather.

The good news is that sitting at a computer on a Saturday morning makes for great soccer watching. The match of the minute is Blackburn - Manchester United. I almost feel sorry for some of the Red Devils' opponents when they are denied points just at the death of a game. Friedel and company made a great effort at stifling the ridiculous attacking talent for 80 minutes, but Tevez and company finally found a way through. Great game to watch, though, especially the last 20 minutes or so. Now it's time for my boys in blue and crimson, the Blaugrana, FC Barcelona. Incidentally, today's match is the first meeting of FCB and their crosstown rivals Espanyol in the Nou Camp since I was there in June. You've got to love derby matches. Too bad this American commentator is piss poor.

My GPS unit has been laying on the floor, unloved, for several weeks now. I need to wrap up some unfinished business from Spring Break. Without further ado, here are several GPS+Google Maps love children, from the 2007 and 2008 Spring Breaks. In 2007 I was able to track the entire road trip, hogging an inverter power socket. The 2008 version only has a few marked points. Fun to explore, no doubt.

. 2008 in Organ Pipe and Cabeza Prieta

Those iframes are not cooperating at all. Pardon my html crappiness as I try to fix them. I win.

I would probably entertain some COD4 on the XBox this afternoon, but my love affair for that game has suffered an irreparable breakup. Last week my stats were reset and the custom classes went crazy. I played a few more games trying to resurrect my lost stats, but it was to no avail. Even now, I can't choose basic weapons and perks (M16, Stopping Power, etc) for my custom classes. Customer support has told me 'there's usually not much we can do". You mean you can't just find my gamertag in the database and delete it? That just seems fishy to me. So, I'm done with it. More time for FIFA.

Indoor game tonight at 6. What time is it? Time to go play yet? Hurry up!

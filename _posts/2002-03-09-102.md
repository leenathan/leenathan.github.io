NO MORE SCHOOL TILL NEVER!!!

according to Travis, since 1 / 0 = undefined, and 2 / 0 = undefined, 1 = 2. I then told him that since a cat isn't = to a dog, 1 = 2. Ahhh, the fun of pre-cal. (while Mrs. Butler rambles on about all sorts of confusing stuff)

then stupid funny movie in Physics. Hunt for Red October would've been better.

yeah, walked over a little kid at Hastings, found out which side of the Mbu the fuel door is on... lalala.

and then Fast and the Furious... the plot was pretty lame, but there were a LOT of fast cars, all of them just souped up sedans. except that one Ferrari....

we both get our out-of-town-ness at the same time! yay. nakie.

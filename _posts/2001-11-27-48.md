haHA! who's making a 100 in Pre-AP Pre-cal? who beat Pat? Lee! Pat really is better than me, so don't be suprised when he makes State. I hope he does. Made a 79 on my physics test, and I dont give a flying #%^. Mrs. Cowley is the stupidest mother f-ing teacher ever, makes no sense, doesn't know what she's talking about, and contradicts herself. I am going to start reading the book and not listening to a word she says during class.

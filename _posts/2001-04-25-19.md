I love History. No really, I do. I love taking Mrs. Kinder's "oh yeah, there's going to be a huge long test over oh, about three chapters. I really don't know which, so just read the whole book. And this packet. Twice. And just to make it more fun, I'll throw in, oh 5 timed writings." tests. There sooooo......sleep-deprivating!!!!

grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

But at least I'm still awake

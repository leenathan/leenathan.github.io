A small prediction

Despite the importance of Earth Day and = the Pennsylvania primary, by far the most important event in the world = happening today is the first leg of the Champions League = semi-final.  Chelsea face Liverpool at Anfield starting in about 15 = minutes.  These two teams have met several times in the past few = years at this stage of the competition and have developed quite the = rivalry.  It has to be devastating to be so close to European = glory, only to be eliminated in the semi-finals.  So without = further ado,

Liverpool 2 -1 Chelsea

  
Gerrard will be immense.

  
An away goal will leave Chelsea with a = hope to salvage the tie, but Liverpool will have the momentum into the = second leg.

The great thing is that while this game = is huge, tomorrow's will be exponentially more exciting. (!)

Another day, another mass shooting in America.

And you don't even need to read the news to know, almost to the word, the stories and narratives resulting from the familiar horror.

Thoughts and prayers. Never thought it could happen here. Unimaginable.

But this is all bullshit. Of course it's imaginable. It's real, and it takes the lives of tens of thousands of Americans every year. Even more are injured, scarred for their entire life, and even more are hurt psychologically. It happens here, there, and everywhere. No corner of America is safe from this scourge.

Thoughts and prayers are important and necessary, but cannot be the entirety of the response to these tragedies. Thoughts and prayers lead to no change in systems, behaviors, and outcomes. Thoughts and prayers don't save lives.

Actions do. Laws do. Enforcements do.

This entire debate seems unique among all other policy debates. Why, in this area, are we complacent to throw up our hands and give up on any meaningful action to resolve this problem? Why are we not even unified in recognizing the problem itself? For any other issue, if tens of thousands of Americans were dying yearly, we would expect honest, good-faith efforts from government to reduce the effects of the problem, to save lives. Will we find perfect fixes? Probably not. Is the lack of a perfect fix a justification for doing nothing? Absolutely not! Policy is a continuous process, constantly updated and reflective of data on the ground and the will of the people. Why has the issue of guns found itself uniquely out of reach from any sort of meaningful reform?

I feel susceptible to teetering into a very cynical space by trying to answer this from my uninformed position, so I won't go down this road too far. The role of the firearm industry deserves heavy scrutiny. Since these players have a financial incentive in selling more and more weapons, they are motivated to minimize any unexpected costs and restrictions to revenue. And both of those come through reformative legislation, so the industry naturally recognized legislative lobbying efforts to oppose any meaningful reform as being crucial to maintaining their business model. So reform efforts fail, more weapons are sold, and more people die. These financial incentives are at direct odds with the public's incentive of not dying from a weapon.

As one of those members of the public, I am going to ensure that my incentive of not dying from a weapon is clearly understood by my representatives in government.

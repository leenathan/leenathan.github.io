SHS drumline busted up some 5A schools last night, and it was funny. Travis threw french fries all over Colter's, and it was funnier. Then i had to sit with him on the way home, and it was scary at times, but it was probably the funniest. then i slept thru church and sunday school. and then i drove my bro a whole half a mile. By myself. (its the thought that counts)

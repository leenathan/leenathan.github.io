Spent the morning tracking down tickets: finding the office (which was an apartment) and making some phone calls. Come to find out that the courier got them to the hostel this morning. Also hit up the Barcelona megastore: spent way too much money on football gear and managed to rip my toe open on an escalator, too. Always wear closed-toe shoes whilst shopping. All along this time I was emailing JJ (ME classmate) to work out a meeting before the game, since we were all headed there. Meanwhile, Ben and I managed to go see Casa Mila (the other melty ice cream Gaudi building) and a bullring. In close succession, I got to the hostel and picked up the tickets, and headed on the Metro and met JJ and his backpacking friend Aaron on Las Ramblas. We proceeded to drink some beer. We drank at one place and had some sandwiches, then headed closer to our bus pickup and had some more. There, we met a British couple that was catching the same bus. We had a beer with them and he had us rolling on the ground with all of his zany stories. It seems like Brits just seem to be funnier because of their accent, or something. He was a huge Portsmouth football fan, so it was really fun listening to him. We headed off to the game in quite the football mood, disappointing that the rest of the bus didn´t share our enthusiasm.

Our tickets got us into some ridiculous seats. We were sitting behind one of the goals, about 30 feet off the pitch, 15th row of the first tier after the pricey super low level. All of this in a stadium that seats nearly 100,000 people. I could pick out all of the Barça stars from where we were sitting: Messi, Deco, Valdes, Eto, Zambrotta, Pujols, Gudjohnsen. It was unbelievable. I´ll get pics up as soon as I can. We were fully immersed in the atmosphere - chants were deafening and the crowd went wild whenever Zarragosa scored against Madrid in a game hundreds of miles away. Unbelievable.

Barça!

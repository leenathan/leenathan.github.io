I've been reading a lot of astrobiology recently. I don't know how I got on the kick, perhaps a recommendation on a book list. But I started with David Grinspoon's Earth in Human Hands, and just finished Adam Frank's Light of the Stars. I'm trying to get my head around how I feel about it. It seems like the subject in general is equal parts wonder and dread.

Wonder for just how far away from the well-trod paths of normal thought the entire subject lies. Why do I feel wonder? Maybe it's the partially a result of the newness of the subject - how recent discoveries of exoplanets in habitable zones of stars have brought about books on the subject written for regular people like me. Perhaps it's the fact that the subject is the results of these discoveries light-years away, never to be experienced in person by anyone alive today. And it's also a result of feeling like I'm part of a massive story, in an incredibly decisive time in human history. That feeling that whatever happens now, during my lifetime, will have enormous ramifications on the project of human civilization. And that's where the dread comes in.

Does humanity have the capability to make a decision to ensure Earth remains habitable for all members of humanity? Can we, as a shared humanity, recognize the wonder that is human life on Earth? And after doing so, can we take action to ensure that wonder continues for generations beyond us?

We have to.

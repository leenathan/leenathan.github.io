So yeah. It snowed last night and most of today. The ground was too warm for it to stick, but it was awesome nonetheless. And where else could you say that you're going fly fishing tomorrow... 15 minutes away from campus? Correct answer: nowhere but Bozeman, Montana - the BEST place in the last best place. Tomorrow is homecoming (woo - hoo) and time to read the next Texts and Critics Book, write a paper, do Chemistry, Math, and make sure that all of my computer games are still working properly. :D

Watching this impeachment trial play out clarifies just how broken our country's politics are. The events of January 6 were plainly obvious, recorded and broadcast in real time online for anyone to watch, and to retrieve afterwards. A violent mob broke in to the US Capitol. The mob sought to stop the work of Congress. The mob assaulted police officers, vandalized, trespassed, and stole. It's not hard to imagine that the mob, if not stopped with deadly force, would have done worse.

The former president knew what the mob would do. If he didn't, why didn't he denounce it in the strongest terms? The man with the loudest platform in the history of earth did nothing for hours after the Capitol was sacked and violence erupted.

This was not the result of a crowd taking a single speech out of context. The President isn't absolved of any accountability as a result of his using the word 'peaceful' in a speech. Why were protesters ready with body armor, Capitol floorplans, and radios? January 6 was the capstone of months of fomenting anger about a lie that the 2020 election was stolen. The President grew this anger starting on the night of the election and unleashed it in its final form on January 6. This argument is a straw man.

And if we are hanging on one single word in that speech, why does that single word get special treatment? Why do Trump's defenders get to cherry-pick his statements to select which words get to be treated literally and which get to be dismissed as jokes or 'unserious' words? That is cherry-picking.

These arguments are not valid but still we hear them being made, because there are no better arguments, and these logical fallacies work to mislead the public. We sure could use a national education about them.

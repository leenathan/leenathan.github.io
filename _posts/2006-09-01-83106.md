Looks like 430 will be minimal in-class time, mostly just group meetings. We'll be designing a heated-slab system to maintain temperature in a medium sized paint warehouse. Wooo. Wasted too much time in the lab today, then billiards, then French, vibes, and then a group meeting with Jenkins. Some French homework, dinner and V for Vendetta over at Megan's, some CS with the Quad Eers, and now sleep.

today was alright, except for all the people gone from classes for a reason that is almost too devastating to imagine.

anyway, me and Travis did some really confusing stuff in AP Chem, and nothing much else happened. I tackled katy, but that's no big feat. Nothing to it. I'm winning, by the way.

good night

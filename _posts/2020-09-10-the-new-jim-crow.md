Started listening to The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander on a long road trip over to Montana and back. It hits hard. If puts together a comprehensive case for why our modern criminal justice system, specifically its current manifestation after decades of the ‘war on drugs’, has become a legalized version of Jim Crow for an entire generation of people of color.

The author goes really deep, and the audiobook is over 18 hours long. It’s divided into several sections, divided along the general flow of the criminal justice system. Starting with law enforcement, then proceedings through the court system and into prisons, then the reentry into society and the ensuing struggle to return to normalcy. At every turn, structures have been put in place to ensure an implicit racial bias impacts people of color disproportionately, and further policy, legislation, and case law precedence prevents people who are swept into this system from having any chance of returning to normal society. It’s a caste system that’s been in development under our noses since the 1980s, and it’s absolutely disgusting.

I’ve been motivated to educate myself much more about this, and to think about how I can better leverage my privilege to help correct the injustice in our system.

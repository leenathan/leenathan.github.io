He was a tall man, says the length of his pants in a small closet next to his Scout uniforms; a busy man too, says the clutter of the desk in an organized way; and a talented, musical man, says the music with chickenscratch scribbles on the stand near the window, allowing cool air inside; but not a man for English, says the pencil moving sporadically, and the eraser bits everywhere.

A brother lived with him, says the room next door and the random babbling and singing for no reason at all heard at all times of day, and they had a mother, says the delicious smells emanating from the kitchen. Time was scarce, say the tired eyes and early alarms and packed backpacks awaiting the campout at week's end. And the summers hot, say the ever-turning ceiling fans.

It was busy here, say the post-it notes' constant reminders. Something happened here, say the aging pictures of brothers and parents in the dust-collecting bookshelf. Boxes of Legos say he once was a child; the building pile of clothes in the laundry basket says she struggles to keep up with her many tasks And the belongings? They lie ejected from the tornado that calls this room home-an OA folder, a shirt that still bears a tag, a wooden canoe paddle, a cigar box shrine. Something happened here, they say.

yay for poetry. not.

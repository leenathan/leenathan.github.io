This was on the front page of the NYT site this morning and hit pretty hard. Hard to believe it's already been a year of suffering and grief through this pandemic. The pictures are evocative, reminding me of empty highways and ferries in the height of the unknown scariness in the spring of 2020. It was positively eerie being out in the world during that time, and even more so considering we were shopping for houses at the time. We treated every house we went into as a biohazard, preferring not to touch any door handle or light switch.

What hit hardest for me was the number quoted in this story - 300,000. Three. Hundred. Thousand. Americans, gone, unnecessarily. A number incomprehensibly high. We owe it to ourselves, as citizens of our country, as fellow human beings living lives together in this place, to never forget this. Never forget the lessons we've learned at such a high price. Never let future generations find themselves bearing such grief.

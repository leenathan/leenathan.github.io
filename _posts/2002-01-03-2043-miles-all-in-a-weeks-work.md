you people sure are long-winded. i get back from my little adventure and have a million posts... and stupid pictures that take for-ever to load... ha. gosh guys.

yeah, went camping in the snow near Ski Apache ski resort outside Ruidoso, NM, then went to South Fork, CO and skiied at Wolf Creek for 2 days. Wolf Creek's base is at like 10,000 feet, so they have better snow than the rest of colorado. But, no high speed lifts, and it was really cold. the resort is kinda small anyways, so we covered the mountain after the first day. Once you have done just about every run at a ski place, it gets boring. all in all, i had a great time... except for one small (more like very hugely important) detail.

it's all good now, i'm back and stuff

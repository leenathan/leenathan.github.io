This weekend turned from a boring book-reading experience to something quite different with just one phone call.

1\. Ice skate in underwear - check 2. Earn Mardi Gras beads in public - check 3. Ski naked.  On an actual ski run.  - check 4. Snowshoe/XC ski in Yellowstone - check 5. Build an igloo, capacity of 4 - check 6. Make and present a V-Day card to an admirer - check 7. Ice fish - check 8. Give flowers to the owner of La Parilla, not at home or at the restaurant - Tuesday 9. Order a beer at the Filling Station in a swimsuit - Tuesday 10. Go dogsledding with 2 dogs - ?

Pending some dogs, we're set for free burritos for a month.  Hell yes.  And I read 30 pages of the 300 page book all weekend.  Who cares?  I don't.

Manning finally gets his due.  Iraq is hopeless.  British rock rocks.  Listen to Boy Kill Boy.

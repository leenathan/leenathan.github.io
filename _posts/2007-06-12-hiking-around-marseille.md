Today we woke up early, had breakfast, and hit the buses to get out to Luminy, a local college. It didn't take us that long to figure out Marseille's public transport system, and we were soon there after a bus transfer. Les Calanques, a protected natural area along the coast featuring some very impressive rock formations jutting out of the ground, is accessible from a trail from the bus stop at Luminy. We hit the trail, navigating ourselves toward the coast (and toward some amazing views). We started heading down to the water, and eventually found a path off the main trail that led directly to the Mediterranean. After passing up a few swimming holes, we found one that didn't have too many sharp rocks. I checked the 'Swimming in the Mediterranean' box on my life's to-do list. It was a really awesome experience. We saw some local swimmers taking part in the fun, although they didn't see the logic in wearing clothes, which was interesting. One snorkeler was _running_ down the path that we were picking our way down. Not only running, but naked running. Crazy French.

After we got back into town, we checked out an old fortress that was disappointingly closed, and then had some pizza from a place across the street. Tomorrow's train to Geneva and Rome leaves at 1 pm, but we might see if we could get on an earlier train to have a few more hours in Geneva.

Cheers!

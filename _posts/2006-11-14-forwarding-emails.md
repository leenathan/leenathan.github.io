How to properly forward a 'chain' email

1\. Open email

2\. Press delete

3\. Done!

If you must forward it on, make sure that the attachment/link/interesting thing is plainly visible, as a link in the body of YOUR email, or an attachment on YOUR email. Note - the link that is in the attached email that is attached to the email you will be sending DOES NOT meet this criteria. Save for this item, delete everyone else's babble about this particular thing being the funniest thing in the entire universe or their testimonials about receiving a check for $128,576 signed by Bill Gates. This might take some scrolling. Delete all of the "FW:" abbreviations in the message's subject. It should appear that you created the original email yourself. Delete carrots or indentations to the left of the message body. After these steps, you should have the following: an email with an easily discernible subject line, possibly an attachment that can be downloaded and directly viewed/experienced, a body message detailing the thing of interest, possibly a link that will directly bring you to the interesting thing, and finally a closing, with your sendoff.

Use Firefox. Don't bitch.

I should make this into a chain e-mail and see how it does. How cool would that be? It wouldn't work...

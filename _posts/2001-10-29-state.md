Everybody gave it their best shot, and we kicked butt. The judges were smoking something reeeallly weird. So, we lost. That's it. But it won't be that simple for us. It's that feeling that we should have placed really high, but we didn't. Maybe we'll learn what made look like 8th place material tomorrow.

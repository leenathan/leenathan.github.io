let's see-

eating breakfast in a bed of a truck going 40 to school waking up at 5:30 to run spending a good 12 hours at the school not having AP Physics, rumors of being booted out of AP Comp Sci, and urgings to drop out of AP Human Geography and memorizing the closer takes a while

all in all, pretty good first 2 days of school.

I was a box yesterday. and then me and Katy took a shower together. yup.

Today was drive around north texas during school day. 7B- Drove to Dillingham, played, drove back. Sat in Band hall, wrestled. 8B- Left school, drove to Southmayd, danced like an Indian (don't ask) for 3rd graders, and came back. We got back to the band hall at like 3:30. It was really strange, realizing that we just drove 40-something miles and did nothing school-related, but everyone would think that we just went to class. whatever.

behind enemy lines. bang.

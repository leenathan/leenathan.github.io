Today we had prime seats for the changing of the guard, ready to watch the replacements march in from Wellington Barracks BUT it was raining and they called it off. We got to see the column of guards march into the Barracks open area, though. Whee. We then headed over to the Imperial War Museum. We went in, paid the fee of nothing, and 6 hours later, I was in a daze being kicked out of the museum. It was fascinating. You could easily spend a day in there. Somewhere in this time, I lost Ben. I determined he was somewhere in London, and made straight for football stadiums and Lilywhites, a purveyor of England football gear. I saw Stamford Bridge and Craven Cottage, and was thoroughly in awe. Tomorrow we'll hit the British Museum and maybe the Library, along with who knows what else. The British Museum might prove to be another time warp...

I logged on to my bank's website to check finances, and laughed at a big list of debit transactions over the last month. Watch the money go down! I'll have plenty to finish off the trip. Donations accepted, however.

London's weather has been pathetic. My expectations have been far surpassed.

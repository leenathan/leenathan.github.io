Over the break, the school took delivery of three wax heaters, and quite a few boxes of wax and cobs.  Today, Lance and I took umpteen boxes from their temporary home in Cundy's office to their permanent home downstairs in 008.  We moved plenty of last semester's materials out of a booth and set up our workspace.  We still need to inventory all of the received materials and send that off to Gary.

Lee's day- 1A, 2A blah History- I used all of the documents on the DBQ! I still probably did crappy, but i know what i meant to say, and thats all that counts. (except for Mrs. Clark's gradebook) bla

I drove to my lesson at the High School, crashed into an 18-wheeler, and died. But i got better. ok. Better study for math and practice. Must... beat... Delise! (Pat is already guaranteed not 1st, but 0th chair)

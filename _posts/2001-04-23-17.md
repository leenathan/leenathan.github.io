Abileine is really far away. Too far away for a campout. However, it doesn't matter because the food was good!

Finally finished Separate Pieces. Stupid book. I agree with Katy. It did not take three hours to read that book. Especially when you start to go fast and you have to go back and reread it. Oh well. Wightman's going to make some big deal about all of the symbols, and I won't really care at all.

Hmmm... maybe I should do homework.

Sorry, this was edited in Notepad....

And now the ridiculously quick recap of Lee's life over the past few days.

Day 2 in Rome - Up way too early for the Vatican - saw the museum and the Sistine chapel.

Have I already told you this? Raphael's School of Athens and all that neat stuff. Only one

Ninja Turtle left - Donatello. There's something of his in Venice, we'll see if we get to

it. Afternoon in Ostia was way cool, saw Roman everyday life. It's completely excavated like

Pompeii, but is a train ride away from Rome. Weather was cooperative as well. Saw the forum,

markets, houses, shipwrights, baths, civic center, and even a fire station. Neat! Gelato,

Trevi Fountain, and Spanish steps with the Roman MSU crew, and we're off to Cinque Terre the

next morning.

Somewhere between Rome and Cinque Terre, we begin to think about nixing our return to Rome

and just spend another night in Cinque Terre. After we arrive, we realize this is a great

idea. Cinque Terre is unbelievably cool.

It's 5 towns perched on mountainsides that run into the sea. They're very small towns, full

of pastel-colored buildings all built up on each other. The towns (and whole region) is

encompassed by a National Park that protects everything and allows for hiking between all of

the towns, and above the towns into the hills. There are beaches at each town, allowing you

to waste the day away as you please. Ben and I did just that. We headed to a pretty rocky

beach near the town just one town away from Riomaggiore where we were staying. The water

was deep and swimmable, but the approach was pretty sketchy, especially due to the choppy

surf. Needless to say, I found a way to injure myself pretty nicely and cut my leg up after

I slipped on the approach. I swam for a while until I realized I was shark bait, so I got

out. My knee was bleeding like a fountain and I got pretty irritated with my ruining of my

Cinque Terre experience. However, there was hope. We walked back to town and went dinner

shopping at the 4 pizzerias to choose from. We got a giant pizza and some pesto-foccacia

bread for way cheap. After dinner, we wandered around town and got some great views. I was

constantly wondering how people could live normal lives in such a fantastic place.

Day 2 consisted of the cross-Cinque Terre hike. We made it to Vernazza (3 towns away) in

about 2 hours, and soon found a new and improved swimming area. Before swimming, we went up

to a cafe recommended by Heather, something with Pirates in the name run by a really nice

man. (Heather-his crazy brother wasn't there yet!) The Peach slush was quite delicious

after getting off the trail. We then headed off to swim. Being very careful not to injure

myself further, I made it out to deep water unscathed. We found a rock to climb and jump

off of in the middle of the cove. All went well until I was introduced to a very rude sea

urchin. He was not happy with my foot being on him, and responded accordingly. I pulled

spines out of my foot and thought I was clear. I thought wrong. We kept swimming for a

while, then hit the rocks to dry off and get sunburned. Finally, it was time to leave, so

Ben gave me all of his gear and ran off on the trail. I, being lazy, took the train.

Ironically, due to crowds and a late train, Ben beat me back to Riomaggiore.

Riomaggiore was described by my friend Rick Steves as the most workaday village and less

touristy. After comparing four of the five villages, I think that despite its 'large' size,

it was the best village. It sure seemed like it was the least polluted with tourism, even

though none of them really suffered from effects like we've seen at all the major cities.

All in all, this place was awesome.

Giacomo charged us way less than he should have for that second night that we hadn't

reserved and the room was nice, too. His outfit just had a bunch of rooms scattered around

town; ours had a skeleton key lock!

Today we headed out of Cinque Terre sadly, through Bologna where we made Bologna sandwiches,

and on to Venice. More fun figuring out local buses, and then we made it into the old city.

(Our hotel is on the mainland, in Mestre) We saw St. Mark's Square and all the bridges.

Rick Steves gave us a guided tour (through his book) while we road a canal bus-boat. We

found dinner via a grocery store, wandered through a residential neighborhood, and got lost

many times. The town is so small (or we walk too fast) that you can't stay lost for very

long. I'm content with our Venice visit, but we have a whole second day! We'll get into

the Basilica and check out some movie filming sites (Italian Job, Casino Royale). Ben wants

to find an English bookstore, and I'll be hunting down some cheap gelato (dinner, anyone?)

That wasn't quick at all.

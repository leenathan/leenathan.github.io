Today:

Didn't sleep too much in math. I was on rounds last night and meant to finish up a take home quiz after the midnight set. Didn't work. I ended up sleeping at my desk until about 3:30, at which point I was very confused about what had happened. So, I went to sleep thinking I'd do it in the morning. Bah. Morning. So I scribbled some stuff before class; should get an okay grade. It was TAKE HOME though! Greade puller-upper, not taker-downer. Whatev.

Slept through statics. I cannot stay awake in that class, or any other, to tell the truth. I'm perfectly awake and functional running on consistent 6 hour nights, but I shut down when I'm not doing anything. Sleeping in statics will kill me. I need to stop.

Chem E 213 - Nodded off, caught about half of this class. Review for the test Wednesday. I should be studying.

Physics - Nodded again. He went over cross products for like 20 minutes. I got so tired of doing cross products last week for statics that I made a calculator program to do them for me. And now, Neumaier decides to go back to the basics. zzzzzzzzzz.

It's halloween week. That means I'll have all kinds of RA stuff to do. AND

Physics Test ChE 213 Test Math Test

and a weighty decision. Ack.

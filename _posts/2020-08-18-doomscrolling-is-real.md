For me, the initial motivation to start the doomscrolling is the hope of being quick to learn about some cathartic discovery that spells the end of the Trump presidency and the return to some sort of normalcy to our national understanding of government. I should have realized that this was never going to happen years ago. Maybe I did, but I still hold out hope that my realization is unfounded.

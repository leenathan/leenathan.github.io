Spain to France involved no train strikes, so we arrived on time.  Spent a while lost trying to find the hostel, but it was worth the wait - this place is way cool!  Very new renovation, with dedicated owners.  Hiked up the big hill to see the Notre Dame de Garde which was awesome.  Interior was mesmerizing.  Outside was quite cool too, giant Jesus statue perched on top with 360 degree views of Marseille.  There were bullet scars all over the walls from fighting in 1944.  On the way back, stopped at Monoprix, a French Walmart and spent some money on supplies.  Made an awesome dinner with some ham, lettuce, feta, and tomato sandwiches.  Had a cool conversation with two girls from Ohio finishing up 3 months studying in Avignon.  Tomorrow brings hiking in the Calanques.  Sweet!

21 hours, 35 minutes till no school according to Katy's watch. hehe.

I heard some stuff about today's finals that wasn't good.... o well. In physics, if you think logically, you fail. If you try to make sense out of something, just ask Mrs. Cowley, and she will erase all of the sense it previously made. quite simple.

i have Nicole's thingy to help study, and i'm going to memorize the history book. maybe not.

I hate French keyboards. The a and q are switched, along with z,q,m, and numbers are all confuzzled with goofy symbols. Caught the train in Amsterdam to Paris, figured out the Metro, scored free RER tickets (with Railpass) and used them to get out to Versailles and some tr√®s short lines. Saw Eiffel tower at night. Did laundry in room. Woke up early; we were among the first 10 people in the Louvre today! Saw rooms full of Greek, Roman, Etruscan, and Egyptian treasures - all to ourselves! Of course, we were zipping through. Saw Samothrace and Venus de Milo in empty rooms. Very cool. We hurried to the free tour of the major Paris sites; it didn't disappoint. After, saw Arc de Triomphe and climbed the Eiffel. I went on an excursion to see the Parc de Princes, where PSG plays! Tomorrow we go to Normandy. Here's a link for a few pictures, sorry that the internet opportunities have been less than stellar.

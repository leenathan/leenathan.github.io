Hello world.  It's been a while.  Life is good here.  I always say that I'd like to keep this thing updated, and then don't really follow up on it - so here's the newest iteration of that.

Summer is finally peeking its way out from the clouds, and we've had a few nice days in the past weeks, with more forecast ahead (yes!).  When the gorgeous days are more infrequent, you tend to take advantage of the gorgeous-ness more often.  Besides, I need to reinforce my tan/burn from the desert.  On a horse with no name.

I'm in the middle of watching Garden State.  I don't know why I haven't watched it before.  I think Zach Braff is hilarious in Scrubs and Natalie Portman is amazing, which makes this movie very watchable for me.  I need to go finish it.

Here's a random question - what's the deal with media players and their visualizations?  I can understand the need for programmers to cater to users that may be in the middle of an acid trip, but I can't imagine that this is a large majority of the total users.  I use Windows Media Player at work, and it's astounding how that giant window is about 80% full of stupid psychedelic craziness whenever you just play a song.   /rant

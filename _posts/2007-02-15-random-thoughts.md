Note - Pretty sure I just figured out why my RSS feed wasn't updating itself = wooo. Random thoughts whilst I avoid working on this 461 Lab Report at 1 am...

I keep meaning to post an update every day.

Why am I hopelessly addicted to soccer? Is it because its cool or adventurous to be a fan of something generally unknown amongst most people? Or is it just that cool. Probably the latter. Whatever. It's truly hopeless.

So with all the talk of a reform in Iraq with the new Congress, we're wasting time by debating a _disapproval_ of Bush's fun little surge? I can imagine all of our lawmakers sitting around debating how hard they want to slap Bush's hands. Is this even constructive?

Any guesses as to how long it'll be till bombs are dropping on Iran? My faith in this administration has reached an all-time low; White House babble these days reminds me _a lot_ of back when they were making claims against Saddam. To me, Iran is quickly becoming the scapegoat and distraction for Iraq.

Pandora rocks my world.

If you own a company in the Northwest with openings for entry-level Mechanical Engineers and are willing to pay me a fine sum of money to work for you, please go ahead and call me and make an offer. Just skip over all those silly interviews.

Don't bitch.

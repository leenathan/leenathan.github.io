concert tonight. wow. big whoop-ee. math test tomorrow. (stupid power outages!) It should have ended last class, but we spent the last 30 minutes of class entertaining ourselves with a flashlight and darkness. The internet died yesterday, and it was insane. All of a sudden, AIM disconnected, and i could dial-up, but no internet sites would load. Stupid internet texoma. finals are next week!!! aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. die.

Katy- don't worry about tackling me and just admit that i win. It would be so much simpler that way. You would just be telling the truth.... ;-)

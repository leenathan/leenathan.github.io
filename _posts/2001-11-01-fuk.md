Fuk hath returned! He was never actually missing, but was in Afghanistan. While in-country, he killed about 12 Afghans and wore a beard. Someday he'll show you pictures. However, hasn't gotten them declassified yet. He has returned to Sher-town and is living happily.

We have 3 tests in 2 days. That sucks eyeballs.

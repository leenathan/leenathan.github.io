Speakers' Corner

British Museum (and a time warp)

British Library

Platform 9 and three-quarters

Longest escalator in London

Had a $20 lunch at the museum, and ate some authentic baked bean breakfast smorgasboard with pasta for dinner (yeah, we can cook!)

Today was the last full day in Europe. Tomorrow we have a hit list - Tower of London, Tate Modern, and hopefully Emirates stadium. With all the beefed-up security, we'll be heading to the airport around 4 for our 8:30 flight. It'll be a long day to stave off the jet lag.

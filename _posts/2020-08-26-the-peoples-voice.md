A failure to respond to the concerns of peaceful protest movements like the one in Kenosha is a failure of government. And as that failure shows citizens their government is unwilling to listen to address their concerns, those protest movements will only continue. And for good reason, too.

One of the responses to these protests is with further policing, to show more force and to use the threat of that force to discourage protesting. But how does this help? It just adds fuel to the fire and provides further proof that protesters’ demands and concerns are not being heard. And to distill the protesters down to ‘mobs’ or ‘anarchists’ or ‘thugs’ serves the same purpose. To use Trump’s words, of course an armed forceful response will make ‘quick work’ dealing with the protesters with ‘no problems’. The protesters are unarmed, non-violent. They’re using their voices , as enshrined by our rights to free speech and free assembly. Use of federal agents to suppress the protesters and then applauding the speed with which the protesters are dispersed merely shows the fallacy in the argument that protesters are are a violent mob intent on anarchy and destruction.

What is Trump trying to prove? That his paramilitary force is superior to protesters? Of course they are; they are professionals hired to show force and put down protests, acting against American citizens who are teachers, doctors, technicians, engineers, and others. Is there any doubt who would win the day in a battle of MRAPs, pepper balls, handcuffs, and horses against umbrellas and leafblowers? If Trump is so insecure that he thrives on seeing horrifying pictures of citizenry bloodied in the streets then this logic makes some sort of sick sense. But then it just goes to directly disprove another seeming motive for the forceful response – that the protesters are so violent, nothing less than an in-kind violent response is warranted. But if it is a violent protest, where are the violent battles against protesters and government? Why do we continue to see victims among the protesters and witnesses, wounded or killed by the forces of the state?

And often it seems like it’s not even the state forces, but other unregulated forces that align their views with those of the state. Like the tragic shooting deaths of two protesters in Kenosha this week, allegedly carried out by a 17-year-old from a different state.

Is Trump encouraging violence? Is he seeking to exacerbate these tensions in our country, for his personal benefit? Trying to whip up fear and division to help his election chances? Fomenting an environment in which local law enforcement is overwhelmed and Trump’s paramilitary goons are the only recourse? It’s disgusting, and not an environment in which I want my family to live.

Dallas to Newark via Charlotte starting at 8:20 am!  Woke up at 4:45 to make it to the airport with plenty of time to stand in the mass of humanity that is the airport check-in area.  Slept through flights (I swear, it never fails) and am now at the plush Best Western Newark hotel, with an incredible room view of the empty conference building 20 feet away from my fourth floor window.  Ben wanted to get into New York, but with an 8:20 flight tomorrow, we need to be on the 6 am shuttle back to the airport.  So, no American sightseeing.  The Atlantic Ocean awaits!  Tomorrow, I'll be doing this from Gatwick airport in London.

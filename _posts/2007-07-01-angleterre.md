So... our last day in Berlin was interesting, to say the least. We hit the airport via train and bus early, with the idea of finding a seat on a earlier fight to Heathrow. This was soon proven to be futile, as the helpful worker informed us we could get on a flight 4 hours sooner for the small sum of €700. I am stumped as to why anyone would cough up that kind of change for 4 extra hours in London.

So, the last day in Berlin was spent cruising on trains that arbitrarily changed directions, "Weren't we going the opposite way when we pulled in to this station?", eating cheap and oh so delicious Turkish Doners, and other exciting things. We played the hurry-up-and wait game at the airport and were finally in the air for our flight with our €75 tickets. The BA flight was great, fine service throughout. We landed, waited in an enormous line for customs, got tube tickets, and were on our way. 3 or 4 encounters with drunk Brits on the way to the hostel were surprisingly enjoyable, and we finally made it to the place. A interesting nght ended with free breakfast. Score!

Today we went on the free walking tour, seeing all of the sights, then we checked out Parliament, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham, Picadilly, the OXO tower, and made spaghetti at the hostel. Tomorrow we'll hit changing of the guard, and who knows what else.

Pictures probably won't get a facelift until I get back home...

Today we headed out to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, a long train ride (on Berlin local S-bahn) and a walk away. The camp was all I expected it to be, except a lot worse and more hard-hitting. The atrocities of the camp strike you pretty forcefully when you're walking around where they all happened. This camp was the home of the main camp inspection force, in charge of managing all of the Nazi camps. It also served as the 'model' for other future camps. The museums and exhibits were very well done, arguably the best we've seen. We spent about 4 hours in the camp.

On the way home, we stopped at the Olympic stadium, which also served as a World Cup venue last year (and hosted the final).

We made a nighttime visit to the partially WWII-destroyed church next to the zoo, with some dark clouds and blue memorial stained glass creating quite the impressive scene.

Tomorrow we're going to hit the airport relatively early and try to get bumped up to an earlier flight to Jolly 'Ol. No matter what happens, we'll be in London tomorrow...sometime.

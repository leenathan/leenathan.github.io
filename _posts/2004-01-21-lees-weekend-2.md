On Saturday, I snowshoed 2.7 miles to Lava Lake and spent the night laughing, eating, and staying warm by the fire with Leif, Ben, Dave, Will, other Will, and Luke. Came back around 1 on Sunday, relaxed, warmed up, and then proceeded to play computer games until 2 am. Woke up at 8, frantically trying to call Leif about skiing. Leif calls around 10 after he wakes up and we go skiing with Ben at Bridger from noon till 4. Came home, tried to do homework, but played more computer games. Call of Duty is addictive.

Going skiing again tomorrow.

Yesterday

![Wow](http://lh6.google.co.uk/image/leenathan/Rn2SVunGlFI/AAAAAAAAAQs/__ms6MqG7M4/P1010122.JPG?imgmax=640 "Wow")

Wow. Awesome.

Goernergrat train, Grunsee lake, and back to Brig.

Today

Brig-Bern

Bern-Zurich

Took a cool walking tour of Zurich recommended by dude on the train

Zurich-Vienna (10 hour train!)

Now I'm in Vienna. Tomorrow we'll go see some old churches, probably some museums, and other old things. Why did I leave the Swiss Alps?

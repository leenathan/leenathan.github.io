I was planning on writing a physics hate post today, but Sterling did it for me. Today in Physics was no exception. Mrs. Cowley proved herself to be incapable of answering some easy conceptual questions. and then proceeded to yell at me.

Oh well. as I told Robin, all the poop is about to hit the fan. ewwww. poop everywhere.

Thankfully, the stuff we are covering now is also something we've done in Chemistry, so I understand it. As long as she doesn't ask the correct way to hang a 50g piece of aluminum on a clothesline.

Anyway, I went to katy's house and colored. her. It was fun. :D

paper = skin

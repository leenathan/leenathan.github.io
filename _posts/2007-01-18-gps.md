Now since we're all heading back to school for yet another semester, here's some educational blogation.

I got a GPS unit for Christmas, and it's awesome. What's more awesome is Google Maps.

Today, Dave, Ben, Doug, Lindsey, and I went on a hike in Bear Canyon that, even though we didn't make it to our destination of Mystic Lake, was a blast. I took the GPS along to get position fixes as we hiked along. As an added bonus, I randomly discovered a geocache that I had loaded on the receiver earlier, but the snow was too deep to find it. Next time... After drying off here at home, I grabbed the tracked route from the receiver and saved it to my computer. Using a site called GPS Visualizer, I was able to take this route file and slap it onto Google maps. From here, I used my keen computer skills (Google searching) to save the map as an html file with my Google Maps API Key and then was able to embed it onto the blog like so: `&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/code&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a id="p50" title="mystic.html" xhref="http://www.tenacious-lee.com/blog/mystic.html" mce_href="http://www.tenacious-lee.com/blog/mystic.html" &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; .`

Bad ass. Hooray for school.

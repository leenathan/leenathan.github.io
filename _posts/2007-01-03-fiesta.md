If you didn't watch the Fiesta Bowl last night, you missed out.  I spaced out and forgot it was on, so I didn't start watching until about midway through the 3rd.  Right in time for the best end of a football game... ever. 

Spare me from explaining the ridiculousness: [Sportscenter recap](http://youtube.com/watch?v=hRjJYHI19Dg "Fiesta Bowl") (again)

 Thanks Mark for reporting deadness.  I figured the original would get wiped from youtube.  This one probably will too, soon.  Watch while you still can!

It's hard not to see the staggering irony of two major events happening live, in front of our faces, today.

On the one hand, the cold/power outage/water shortage/general humanitarian disaster unfolding in Texas is shocking, and becomes more shocking as more details emerge. The shock factor increases both as stories from amidst the disaster emerge for outside observers, and as the situation continues to evolve and present new hazards to the millions affected. The longevity of the crisis and the depth to which it has affected aspects of modern life that are assumed to be a guarantee - power and potable water - is unfathomable. It would be one thing if the disaster involved some sort of impossible technological challenge to overcome, but it doesn't. It's an electrical grid and a water supply system that wasn't properly prepared for a not-improbable weather situation. The fix for this disaster is maddeningly simple - winterization. Other areas of the country have overcome this challenge for generations, but the Texas system opted not to follow those examples, presumably for cost-saving reasons. The Texas grid also split apart from a larger national grid, presumably relying on the perceived big-ness of Texas and power supply facilities across the state to mitigate risk of power supply loss, not foreseeing a weather situation impacting the entirety of the state. It's important to remember this isn't the fault of one particular fuel or provider or some other singular component - it's the fault of the system that allowed these risk-aggressive decisions to be made and implemented. And millions of people are hurt as a result.

On the other hand, I'm watching a live stream of a car with a helicopter onboard land on a planet 127 million miles away.

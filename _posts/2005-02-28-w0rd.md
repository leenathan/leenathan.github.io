Tonight my hall held an Oscar Party that was quite impressive. Big screen, sound system, hall awards, food, and fancy clothes. During the show, I realized why I hate Hollywood and all that junk so much. It either came when Chris Rock made joking fun at the whole movie award thing with his hilarious intro (77th and last oscar show), or when they played a clip from "The Aviator" where Hughes (Leo) said "You're a movie star, that's it" or something like that, or possibly when Dustin Hoffman presented an Oscar completely drunk (announcing nominees - "Million Dollyar Bayeee"). That last one really got to me. After dealing with so much alcohol-induced shit this year, this display of teenage immaturity and complete unprofessionalism made my respect for this community hit an all-time low. And don't say that he just made a bad decision. He knows how many people watch this show, and he knows that he is a role model for many who stupidly idolize him. Knowing this, he abused his expensive alcohol and made a complete jackass of himself in front of his peers (who probably enjoyed his presentation) and the rest of America.

These people - overpaid and overhyped - are idols of American society? Not me. I read an article in the paper today about how all award shows are dwindling from their once-prominent place on the tops of TV ratings listings. I hope that fall accelerates into oblivion.

My opinions. Leave a comment if you see fit.

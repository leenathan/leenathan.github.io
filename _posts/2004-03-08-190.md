Lee's weekend:

Friday night - LAN party!!!!!!!!! Played Call of Duty, Counter-Strike, Desert Combat, Need for Speed Underground, Rise of Nations, and Starcraft till 9 am on Saturday. Quite fun.

Saturday- sleeeep, then some homework. meh

Sunday - homework meh. But I made a new mousepad! My old mousepad that I used at the LAN was some random printout that I had scribbled all over and taped to my desk. Whenever my mouse went blind, I just made a new mark wherever it was blank. My new mousepad is an upgrade. I downloaded an awesome program with the capability to calculate Pi to 32 million digits. So I calculated 512,000 digits, shrunk it down to size 4 font, printed it out and taped it down. So now, my mousing surface is 1/15th of Pi to 512,000 digits. :D I'm such a nerd.

Ty absolutely smoked me and Chuff in two races over the network today. Chuff gave up and turned around and started running into Ty; good times were had by all.

So now, its sleepy time for calc at 8; and then I'll be writing papers for the rest of the day tomorrow, = boo.

Enjoy your spring breaks and such, someone give me a time machine.

Tickets aren´t here. :(

Saw lots of Gaudi today - Sagrada Familia, that melting ice cream building (but not the other one) , and a sweet park. Also one of the Olympic parks on top of the Montjuic - stadium and gardens. Also the MNAC, a fancy art museum that we didn´t go into. There was some Toyota expo below there with vehicles driving all over these crazy ramps and such. Also on Montjuic we saw a castle retrofitted with some big guns, probably for the Spanish civil war. Barcelona has quite the fortress to defend it from the coast. The views from up there are impressive to say the least.

Tomorrow, hopefully I´ll be able to find out where my tickets (that I spent quite a pretty penny for) are, and we´ll hit the FC Barça megastore. We´ll be wearing the right colors for the game.

Last night I had an interesting dream: I was dreaming that one of my friends could control time.  When my alarm clock went off, I jumped out of bed and turned it off, but then went right back to sleep thinking that my friend could just slow down time so I could sleep some more.  Not really.  I should have been waking up and getting ready to go to school.  Somehow, I woke up 15 minutes before I needed to be at a group meeting with a prof in Roberts Hall.  I stared at my clock incredulously, not believing the time it was showing was the 'real' time.  Weird.

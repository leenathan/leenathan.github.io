good job to everyone who went to Phase 2! I thought we did pretty well this year, but, as usual, some of us Sher-town people got screwed out of bands and area. anyway, no more trombone practicing for me for a loooong time.

Physics test tomorrow.

I LOVE MY KATY! more than she loves her Lee. i win.

where did that snow come from?

Good job kT. I made a 98 on a Pre-AP Pre-Cal Test. Ha.

Anyway, if the Army would hook me up with some of the equipment up their sleeves (video cameras on guns, super-silencers) , I would go to Afghanistan and bust up some Aghan-terror punks. You just know their peeing their pants right now, hiding in caves cause we're about to kick the living #$%#%@! out of them.

Travis, I'll whoop up on your physics for ya.

Other Travis, don't die. Benadryl is helpful, so is some kinda dose-pack of somethingorother that I sometimes take. I'm sorry I don't know what it is, but I could find out if you want. You need a prescription, but its powerful stuff. Sounds like you're on the rebound so I wouldn't worry about it.

in other news,

**LAN Party TOMORROW!!** wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! I found a program to play Need for Speed Underground over the local network, so we'll be racing in addition to shooting each other. I think we'll have a car style contest, too. My Skyline is quite slick. :D

I hate crossword puzzles. If one word doesn't fit, you start questioning all of the other words. Or is it the puzzle? Or could it be the teacher? AAAAAAAA oh well. What did we do at school today???? It was funny in Pre-cal when we told Mrs. Butler exactly how much Mrs. Cowley has taught us. \*Okay class, you've learned how to do this in physics, right? "Wha? Huh? Mrs. Cowley hasn't taught us any.. We haven't learned anythi.. AAAAAAAAA!" Very funny. Of course in physics, what do we do? Swing water around. Oh well. Its beyond stupid now. No one cares.

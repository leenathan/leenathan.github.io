Woke up, figured out there was free breakfast downstairs in the hotel part of the hostel/hotel. It was an awesome free meal, cereal, eggs, the works. Afterwards, we figured out the ferry situation behind Centraal Station and got north of the city, into Dutch countryside. We rode through various towns (all of which whose names elude me now), stopped at a supermarket to supplement our lunch of nutella sandwiches, and ate some lunch under a bridge along a canal. Afterwards, we navigated back into town to return our bikes, walked home back to the hostel (picking up some of the Netherlands greatest fries on the way back), and hurried over to the Heineken 'Experience' which was all about the history of Heineken (not to mention three drinks AND a bottle opener in a cool container for only 11 euro!) Now I think its dinner time, with some packing, postcard writing, and sleeping before the early train to Paris tomorrow.

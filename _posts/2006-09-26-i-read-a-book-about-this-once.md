It was called "Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"

It hasn't been too bad, but damn it could have been a lot better.

Last night:  Hibernated computer, went to sleep.

 Today: Woke up.  Turned on computer.  Got dressed, ready to roll out to study some French before HVAC.  Computer couldn't find hal.dll, no Windows.  Couldn't find phone.  Ate breakfast.  Looked for phone more, cursed at computer.  Dozed through HVAC.  Drank helluvalot of Mountain Dew, studied for French.  Almost ran short on time for French test.  Fought Pro/E to display a section line for half hour.  Home, tried to make computer work with recovery console magic.  Needed more magic.  Frantically threw on formal clothes, went to desk to work.  Ran to SUB, tying tie whilst running (hell yes).  Almost showed up late to Etiquette Dinner.  Worked desk til 10.  Phone found in Megan's car.  Yay.  Tried to fix computer more.  Formatted unpartitioned space on SATA drive in attempt to repair Windows.  Bill Gates magically deleted ~50 gb of stuff on SATA.  WHAT THE FU#K?!  New installation of Windows.  Attempting to get files back.  This sucks.  I'm going to sleep.  When I wake up, everything will be fixed.

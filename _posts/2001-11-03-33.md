Howdy dudes. I am typing into a tv using a wireless keyboard....pretty cool. Me and Jarv are at the wyndham hotel next to the ballpark to cheer on Jake and DJ at the Region CC meet. On the way to the foosball gme, Fuk went on a trip. thanks to my skill and prowess, (and help from Don and kT) he was found! yeah ok. another trip to Afghanistan. Wearing katy's pants on my head was fun too. Travis wants to eat the internet now. here you go travis. Goodbye. \*this is travis\* yum yum yuum yu7h yum3r477gfoii6qweorfth7yef fgh dyug s d hb sdfg dfgdfsd sdjhdgbwei6y3489v479 48937pergser.

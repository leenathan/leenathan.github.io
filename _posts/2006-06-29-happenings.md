I'm tired of working in the machine shop.  I'm almost done with the part I'm working on, hopefully it all be analysis of the film from here on out.  Definitely not a MET here.

Soccer game tonight was a good showing for the Forest Green.  I played alright, got really tired before half, and made some regrettable moves in the second.  But again, found some good through balls and passes to people.

Just found a way to rip Pandora.  w00t.

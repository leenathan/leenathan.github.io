9800 xt = this weekend (hopefully) Counter Strike: Source = next week Half-Life 2 = very, very soon

Lee = happy. So happy, in fact, that the actuality of having 3 possibly VERY painful tests in the next week does not phase me.

in other news, all of you folks should check out Mozilla FireFox, which happens to rock IE's socks off and then some. http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/

Once you have done that, go check out Gaim, a IM program that works a helluvalot better than Trillian. It seamlessly integrates all of your chat programs into one nice organized pile of ness. So yeah. http://gaim.sourceforge.net/

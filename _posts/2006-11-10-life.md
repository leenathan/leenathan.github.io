I went to Edwards Air Force Base in Cali last week, for an interview with the Air Force Flight Test Center.  I would be working in the weapons branch as a civilian engineer, developing and running tests to make sure weapons work.  Edwards was badass - they have 8 jillion square miles of air space, and you can find just about every active aircraft in the Air Force there.  After I looked into the weapons bays of a B-1 and a B-52, we sauntered over to a huge array of inert bombs they had out, at which time we heard two F-16s break the sound barrier overhead. 

 They said that was a normal day.

All told, it was a sweet trip.  Aside from missing my flight out of Bozeman and dealing with LA traffic at 9:30 at night, I had a great time. 

430, 404, and 454 all promise to kick Lee's ass in the near future.  Hopefully a few full work days in the future will pave the way to a not-so-stressful end of the semester.  We'll see.

I'm glad the rubber-stamp congress is a thing of the past.  Checks and balances are a good thing.  Now the politicos need to make good on the promises of working hard to fix what's gotten out of hand in the past few years.

Today we woke up and grabbed some free breakfast at the hotel. It was pretty nice, but not the best we've had; they had eggs in Amsterdam. But you can never beat free. We headed into Venice after waiting for the bus down the road. Once in the old city, we caught a boat bus around to by St. Mark's Square. It didn't go through the grand canal, but we got to see the cruise ships docked and the back side of Venice with more old buildings. Those 'vaporetti' drivers are pretty good to get right in there on the docks for each station.

Rick Steves really is the man. He recommended checking bags across the street from St. Mark's Basilica and using the bag check ticket to skip the line. This line was long. Tons of miserable tourists standing in the sun. I checked my small little daypack and was thumbing the claim ticket as I looked for where to 'cut' in. Evidently one of the gatekeepers was lecturing someone on how to do what we had just done and said something like, "...when you do that, you get one of these," and he gestures to my card and lets us in, easy as that. Total wait time - 10 seconds. Sweet! The basilica was amazing, up there (maybe even surpassing) with St. Peter's at the Vatican.

We then went to get tickets for the Doge's palace, another Rick Steves suggestion. He recommended getting tickets at some other museum and then skipping the ticket-buying line at the palace. Our scheme to pose like Brit students and get the student deal failed so we paid full price BUT we skipped another long line and strolled right into the place...again. The palace was another display of Venetian power - full of ornate rooms for the Doge and the governing bodies. More impressive art by dead people whose names I don't remember. We also got to go across the Bridge of Sighs and see the prisons. Although we paid more here than we did at the Louvre, it was impressive and worth the money.

Honestly what is up with all these places offering student discounts that specify EU students only? That's a bunch of malarchy. I paid $22 for a US Student ID that hasn't even paid itself off yet. Everybody recommended getting one, but I have not been impressed. Grr.

After the Doge, we grabbed lunch and went off on a couple of quests. First, we found the Church of the Friari, a Franciscan church filled with - you guessed it - artwork. More importantly, there was a work of Donatello inside. After seeing his wooden statue of St. John the Baptist, we completed the Ninja Turtle tour of Europe. Here's the recap:

Paris - Louvre - Leonardo - Mona Lisa (and 4 others)

Rome - Vatican Museum - Raphael - School of Athens

Rome - Vatican Museum - Michaelangelo - Sistine Chapel

Venice - Church of the Friari - Statue of St. John the Baptist

w00t.

We took a 50 cent gondola ride. Check it.

Then we went to go find the house that was robbed in the intro of the modern Italian Job movie (We were sure of the area, just couldn't find/recognize the damn thing) and the building that was demolished in Casino Royale (same story).

After that, we wandered around some more, and had dinner. Dinner consisted of 4 courses, all of which happened to be gelato. After scouting various gelato shops yesterday, we stopped at the ones with the best prices. We each had 16 scoops of awesomeness, with a nice hike to get ready for the next course between each.

Tomorrow its off to the Swiss Alps. We're saying Ciao to the joke of an Italian rail system and going back to a real one.

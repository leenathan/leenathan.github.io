what happened today?

Pre-cal- boring trig stuff Physics- test NO COWLEY!!!!!!! There was an air of intelligence in that room for once. BAnd- Pat is laugh-aholic. He messed up real bad when we were playing something, and we both couldn't stop laughing for like 10 measures. haha cross-country- we "ran" around school. (went to the band hall where frank had put together new stands. which is where travis got his cardboard boxes to destroy.)

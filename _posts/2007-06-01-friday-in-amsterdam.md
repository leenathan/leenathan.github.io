I'm really tired.

'Free' walking tour from 11 - 2, saw all the important stuff and got the history behind it all, interwoven with jokes and, when needed, a laugh track. Our guide Donald was outstanding - he earned his pay from tips at the end. After that, we wandered around for a while, had a Heineken next to one of the canals, and then moseyed over to the bike emporium to rent bikes. We rode back to the hostel and decided to go grab some dinner at a cheap pasta place with some Canadians we met. The restaurant was on a mysterious street that I still don't think existed. After searching in vain, we gave up and found a cheap pizza place ('XXL New York Taste'). Afterwards, Ben and I went cruising around Amsterdam: through several parks and who knows how many different neighborhoods. It is amazing how it seems that mostly all of the city stays up really late, drinking beer outside of cafes past 11 and later. Of course, it is a Friday night, and it is Amsterdam. Now, time to figure out how the hell I use this goofy phone card and to convince First Interstate to undo the hold on my card. Maybe I should have told them I was going to be using it in Europe...

Tomorrow: hopefully we'll be able to get out and ride some Danish countryside, or something.

Dave rented a cabin from FWP out past the ski area, so I went out there after class Friday and chilled (literally) with Dave, Katie, Chelsea, and Ben. We slept till 10 and then went out and snowshoed up to the top of the ridge behind the cabin. I had to head back into town to help set up the Mistletoe Hop, Langford Hall's traditional holiday dance. The decorations and shat were great, and the dance was unbelievably awesome. I was Santa for an hour and just went around dancing with everyone. All the prep that went into that was well worth it, especially my 'advertising blitzkrieg.' Homework time. :(

Oh yes, Need for Speed Most Wanted owns me.

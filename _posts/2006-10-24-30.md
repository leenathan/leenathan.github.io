I keep meaning to summarize my thoughts on the political situation in our country and the impact we make on the world. Here's a start. I didn't write it, though. "In a contest between foreign power and native understanding, foreign power -- however much material and military strength it can wield -- will always lose. Even in an era when a sense of racial superiority and colonial entitlement led Western nations to have few qualms about subjugating others, eventually native power based on native knowledge would reassert itself. Nowadays the reclamation of power asserts itself much more quickly but it always rises out of the same awareness: _this is our land, not yours; it is ours because it is the place we know."_

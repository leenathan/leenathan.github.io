My parents aren't home.... Party at Lee's house!! except not. I saw on the news that the MLB is planning on cutting teams for next years season to decrease losses. Expos and Twins got the most mentions, but they were also talking about the Marlins and some others. thats pretty weird. Our economy isn't doing so hot. Oh well. as long as we keep feeding the taliban more 15,000 (!!!!!) pound bombs, I'm happy. :D

Bought 24 hour public transport pass for maximum tram usage; dropped bags at hostel and headed to Rijksmuseum and Van gogh museum, saw lots of paintings that are famous. Ate some lunch at a street vendor near the museums. The near-sleepless night at Gatwick took its toll, though, so we went to the hostel, checked in, and checked out of consciousness. I slept for 5 hours and thought it was the morning when I woke up. It was around 9 at night, so we grabbed some dinner at a grocery store and did a walking tour of the Jordaan and the southern area where our hostel is at. Tomorrow, we get bikes!

today i ran from the high school across hsy 75, around the courthouse, and back to school on Houston or Lamar- whichever one runs East. that's a long way.

Oh yeah fyi- Joseph was pushing a pygmy rattlesnake to keep some smaller Scouts away from it on a campout this weekend. The snake was about 8 inches long. The stick he was using to move it was a bit smaller than 8 inches. Needless to say, 24 hours later and after a trip to the Athens, Texas hospital, Joseph's hand looked like a marshmallow. He'll be at school tomorrow and no, he's not dead. Little rattlesnake venom never hurt nobody...

:D

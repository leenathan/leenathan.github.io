July 4th - Condensed because I'm lazy

Friday night - Pickle Barrel, Shakespeare in the Park (the last half of Love's Labour's Lost)

Saturday - Burned CDs until like 4 am, woke up at 6, Mountain Dew caffeine-induced drive to Sheridan, peeing on frontage road.  Mine tour with Amy, everyone falling asleep, Albertson's, up to Bighorn (drove forever into the woods!), tent, sleep.

Sunday - lazy.  woke up around noon, swam in bitter cold water, ATVs to get water, trail on the way back.  Cards in the camper when it rained.  Smores

Monday - less lazy.  Breakfast, then up to a trailhead to a sweet view on a fire lookout station.  Then ATVs to water again, sweet trail on the way back, sprayed Amy and Heather.  Will had fun splitting logs at camp.  smores - better.

Tuesday - Breakfast, then long trail ride on ATVs, up to a couple of vistas, and all through the surrounding woods.  Girls packed at camp.  Headed back down into town, stopping at Steamboat Rock (didn't look like a steamboat) for a sweet short hike.  Showers at Amy's, then to polo grounds for fireworks.  Lots of frisbee, then fireworks, then laughing at everyone idling their cars for eons waiting to get out.

Wednesday - woke up at 5 to head back to Bozone.  Back at 8:30 or 9.

woot.

band- nothing english- watched Frasier. what kind of crazy teacher would let us watch Frasier in class? Mrs. Robinson! She is so carefree usually, which is pretty cool. Mrs. Clark on the other hand.... She got REALLY mad at us today. I really didn't understand why she got that torqued. There were a lot of people that were concerned about getting a good grade on that thingy, and what she had us doing wasn't working at all. After about a minute of that, i gave up and didn't care anymore. Whatever dude. AP Chem- did some stupid confusing stuff- with magnetic stirrers.... around and around and around

and Don said that Mrs. Cowley had a severe case of the stupid today. We really need to do something with her. Its fun not doing anything, but we need to learn something in there. Me and Travis Spoon were thinking of trying to get a suprise assistant-principal check-up of our class. Any other ideas?

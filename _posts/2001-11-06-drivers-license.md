Lee finally got his license!!!!!!!!!!!! It was so incredibly ironic: how many times in the past months I had to whine at mom to get it..... and how fast it took to actually get it. Probably stood in line longer than it took to sign some stuff, read off some "small" numbers, sign an electronic pad, put my thumbs on another pad, and stare into a camera. Oh well. I'm legal!

Back to the cram sheet.

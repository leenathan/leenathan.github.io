So where did I leave you? Paris - third day. Train leaves St. Lazare at 1830, so we have another day to burn in Paris! We saw Montmarte and the Sacre Couer, an amazing (imagine that) old cathedral with some kind of architecture that now eludes me. Quite cool, even in a 'tourist mecca' as I like to call it. Ate lunch in a French cafe with Italian faire that was playing Hispanic music. The required cafe stop, of course. After this, we cruised the metro for a while, catching up with a cool station I saw on the way to Parc de Princes, as well as tracking down this sweet moving walkway that was faster than most, featuring ingenious accelerating and decelerating areas. Joyride! Somewhat wasteful of Parisian time, but we were sightsee-ed out.

Our first local train experience was good, caught the train no problem and the printed tickets worked well (after the conductor tried a few times with Ben's). And 2 hours later, we were in Caen. Oh Caen. Got in around 2030, and I immediately realized the implications of not printing out directions/map/anything about the hotel we were at. Finally we found the street randomly on a map - way the hell out of town. Oh ok, take the tram to here, then catch the #16 bus. Quick, buy the tickets! No change! Go to the Tabac and get change! Doesn't understand Ben! Aaaaaack. Ben's phrasebook saves the day and we get 24 hour passes for the tram and bus. Tram ride is successful to Poincare, the connection. Ohhhh wait - Bus 16 runs 10 times A DAY, during rush hours. 9 pm? We're SOL. Looks like we're hiking. I draw a map on a piece of paper and take a picture of the bus map with our street on it. And we're off. After a wrong turn and asking a French man the location of the street that we happen to be walking on, we're on track. Get into the room, and its awesome! I'm less worried now, but still anxious about our prospects of getting to Normandy the next day.

We woke up an hour late. Pack quickly, and survey breakfast possibilities - they looked good, so we spent 5 Euro and gorged ourselves on a great meal. Hit the tram (after hiking back) and got to the train station and found the Bus Verts station, the regional bus line. Asked the lady about getting to a 'plage de guerre' (beach of war, I know, I'm quite fluent :D) and she pointed us toward Juno beach, the Canadian landing 63 years ago. Caught the bus, and we're on the way. The stop at the beach was perfect. There is a great memorial there and we caught an English tour. Saw bunkers (several were overturned from sand dune movement), as well as crosses and other monuments. The weather was horrid - windy and cold, very similar to what GIs may have seen when they landed. It was a very awe-inspiring experience, especially talking with a British veteran and seeing so many other Canadian vets there for the memorial service. Very impressive; I wish we had more time in the area.

Came back to Caen, burned some time and saw an 11th century castle, free museums about Normandy, and a Gothic cathedral. Very worthwile and picturesque. Met some Texans who had lost a passport and railpass (yikes) and were backtracking at the Caen 'gare.' Back to Paris, easy Metro ride, and we're at the Hotel, Hotel de la Terrasse. Lets hope my crappy attempt at French will let the funny reception guy use the 'net for free!

Au revoir

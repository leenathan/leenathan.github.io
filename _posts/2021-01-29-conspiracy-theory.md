Can a conspiracy theory become religion? What's the difference between the two?

Is it historical? As in, once a set of beliefs have been in the mind of society for long enough, does a conspiracy theory become a religion?

Or is it the substance of the set of beliefs? If the beliefs require the believers to set aside facts and believe in some higher power, does it make it a religion? Or is it a matter of the breadth of the beliefs, in the size of the network needed to wield power?

Is it the prevalence of the belief? Once a conspiracy theory hits some critical threshold of believers within a population, does it become a religion?

Or are they separate entities, never shifting from one to the other? Is a conspiracy theory only reserved for malignant ideas, for an end result of malice towards someone? That seems pretty subjective, and all religions can't claim to not meet this criteria. I don't think that would work to be a clear delineation between conspiracy theory and religion.

I don't see a clear distinction between the two. I'm left with the supposition that at some point during the life of a conspiracy theory it can become a religion. Which factors are most impactful along the way? Historical life, substance, breadth, societal prevalence, or something else? It depends. But it sure seems like the unhinged Q theory is well on its way to becoming a religion.

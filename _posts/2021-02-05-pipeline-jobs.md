What is a pipeline job? What happens to a pipeline job after the pipeline is built?

Why is there so much furor over the loss of pipeline jobs as a result of pipeline projects being rightfully cancelled after consideration of the negative externalities on carbon emissions? Don't the majority of pipeline jobs get cancelled anyway, after a pipeline is built? It's not like we're employing people to carry buckets of oil hand over hand in a big long line! Sure, a surge in labor is required to build a pipeline. It's a big logistical project, to prep land, acquire and assemble material, install those pieces in place, and then to test the entire assembly prior to going live. But then it goes live, and all of the labor required for all of that is no longer needed. What remains is a few folks to monitor and maintain the thing. What happens to all those former pipeline jobs?

As far as I see it, pipeline jobs are short-lived, and will require a pivot at some point. It could be now, with an added benefit of reducing emissions, or it could be later, for the price of additional emissions related to the fossils that flow through a pipe. Not buckets.

So let's make the decision to do it now, and keep those fossils in the ground. And let's ensure that the folks who would have been working a pipeline project have all of the support and training and opportunities to get to work on a project that benefits our economy and our environment.

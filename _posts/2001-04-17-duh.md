Okay. Fine. Today was not an A-day, but a B-day. However, due to the chapter's boring nature, it will require most people to begin reading it a day in advance. I only posted that comment so that the readers of it could be extra prepared for Kinder tomorrow. Some of you just use the earliness as an excuse to call me stupid. Therefore, your comment earlier today, KT, about me calling you stupid is justified. You also, although it was wrong and untrue, called me stupid. So ha!

We need another phone line.

Oh yeah, almost forgot today's oxymoron/paradox.

Today is opposite day.

Viva la gato.

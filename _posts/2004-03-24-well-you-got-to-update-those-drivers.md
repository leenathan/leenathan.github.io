I got my T&C paper back yesterday. I thought it wasn't one of my best efforts, but my prof thought otherwise. She was completely amazed and gave me an A+! I WIN.

I have a TV card in my computer so I can watch TV on it, but up until now I never could get the audio and video to sync. Last night, I was messing with a Winamp TV plugin and ended up downloading new ATI drivers for my TV program that came with the card. These new drivers fixed the problem, so woo.

Snow is melting away here, weather is showing perpetual 60 degree sunny days. :D

and Joseph is on lj now, his screenname is jofus06.

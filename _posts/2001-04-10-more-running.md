I ran the 2-mile today, and got 8th or something (I don't really care) and then we had to leave and come here for the NHS thingy. Personally, I thought the ceremony was a lot of hype over nothing. Sure, NHS is a great program, but couldn't we have a better ceremony?? Anyway, I get to miss 6B and part of band tomorrow, and then leave rehearsal early to go run the mile. Woo-hoo! oh wait. I've gotta run. Again. Really fast. DARN! Wish me luck. Hopefully I can set a new PR. (thats personal record, for all you non-runners)

Wow! thats my longest post ever!

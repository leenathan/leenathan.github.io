Took some tests.  Flew home.  Sat around.  Went to the Grandparents'.  Came back. 

 

I was tantalizingly close to a 4.0 this semester... even though I really wasn't expecting it.  Hooray for engineering.  Grades and tests are dumb, but they are the best (read: easiest) way for colleges to quanitze your intelligence.  It's just silly how a large percentage of my college knowledge will just go flying out the window when I start real work.

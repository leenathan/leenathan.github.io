CS with Quad peeps late into the eve.  Doctor's appointment in the morning, he told me to go see a therapist.  He recommended a really good doc but, of course, it will be expensive.  Then some HVAC with (again) really broad, non-quantitative discussion.  Cook seems like a cool prof, though.  Some more French studying for a quiz that was really long and proved that I should have also studied passe compose forms of some irregulars.  Meh.  Then worked a little, did some HVAC, and got 404 group assignments.  I got my third choice - the automated wax application onto corn cobs, not too happy about that one. Then I went and talked to Sally and got my name up front for Ken's single in Quad A (w00t!).  Bball by the skate park, dinner with Weather and Amy, then food shopping for the marathon camping trip to Froze to Death.  Oh yes.  Excitement.

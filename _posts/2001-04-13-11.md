Wow. We got straight 1s at UIL. Don't you think we should if we rehearse for umpteen hours a day?! Not like my weeks are busy enough! Oh well. I don't care, because there's no school tomorrow!!!!!! I plan on slacking off and accomplishing absolutely nothing! Except worshipping cat.

Oh yeah, I bought Gladiator so we can watch it at DC. I'm not too excited about seeing the monuments again (although, to show more American pride, the monuments are very awe-striking), but I can't wait to see the air and space museum again. Its really cool!

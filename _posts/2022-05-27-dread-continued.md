So the dread continues. Dozens of kids massacred in a Texas elementary school is the latest reminder that the dread is ever-present, just occasionally hides from time to time.

But there's a common thread that I've been thinking about recently. For me, the biggest sources of dread are those that threaten our future, the promise of opportunities for my family that are years ahead. These opportunities rely on a few basic assumed conditions - safety, comfort, familiarity - which current events and tragedies and trends can threaten. These conditions are so basic and so fundamental. Personal health, family health, happiness, a clean environment. Their fundamental nature means that they fade to the background of consciousness and perception in day-to-day life. They are assumed to be present and unchanging, constants. Life is built on top of that solid foundation and future planning can be lofty and optimistic, as that planning builds continuously into improving life.

But take away that foundation, those assumed conditions, and everything else falls apart. Future planning is impossible. Day-to-day life is occupied with concerns about those basic conditions. And with that concern comes dread. Dread for the future. Maybe not for the next day or the next week, but dread for the lost potential of the further future. Dread for my kid's childhood. Dread for my retirement. Dread for the trajectory of the country I used to know.

The massacre in Uvalde has reminded me that the number one cause of death for kids in this country is firearms. Not motor vehicles, not drowning, not disease. Firearms. The product that is ostensibly marketed as a tool for self-defense. The product kills children. More than anything else. The trends are there. The data is stark. The numbers do not lie.

And so, presented with these facts, the natural reaction is to ask why. Why are our children more likely to die by firearm than anything else? Why doesn't this happen in other countries? Why has it gotten so bad here? Why? Why? We ask questions to start to find solutions, to try and solve the problem. Maybe not all of it, all at once, but at least partially. Incrementally. Find a root cause and try to fix it. And then do it again. That's natural. In some regards, it's engineering. It's what I do for my job.

And, of course, it's worked. Other countries have taken drastic action to reduce gun violence, after being spurred into motion by tragic mass shootings. Awful massacres occur and citizens and politicians alike recognize that what has happened is unacceptable, and changes are made.

But not here. Not in America. With Uvalde, I'm reminded there's another line of 'why' questioning. Why aren't we trying to solve the problem?

And after thinking about those questions, I came to the realization that the massacres are not a problem, but the point. An industry that sells its product promising protection to customers relies on tragedies as marketing opportunities. The slaughters are selling points. They market via massacres. These massacres are not a problem, they are the industry's solution to sell more guns. We're not trying to solve the problem because we don't think a problem exists. The slaughter of our children with guns is a price our society pays to continue our collective relationship with the gun industry. Our perceived freedom to defend ourselves with guns from violence ostensibly arising from guns is deemed to be worth a few children's lives. And the monster grows. More guns make more massacres more likely which provides more reasons for self defense which drives more gun sales which make more massacres more likely, and on and on. And along the way, society becomes more accepting, tacitly, of the slaughtering of children. Sure, there are signposts along the way. One just happened in 2020 - guns becoming the leading cause of death in kids, passing cars. But why would we think that one more massacre will make the difference? Why would one more slaughter result in change, when the mountain of bodies that has amassed prior to this one did not?

And so I dread. I dread for this ever-increasing bodycount, for the active shooter drills, and the fear of 'gunmen' I will need to instill in my kid. I dread for my country. Don't get me wrong, you can be damn sure I'll be calling legislators, holding signs, and doing everything I can to move society off of our trajectory of mindlessly accepting the slaughter. But damn, will it be dreadful.

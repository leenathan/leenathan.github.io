NOAC tomorrow, then 5 days at home, then Montana.

Hey college dudes and dudettes, what are some good ideas for activities/programs for the beginning of the year that you have experienced? I am open to suggestions for my upcoming RA-ness.

Also, if anyone needs one or a few very spiffy 25 foot CAT6 cables, inquire within. These would be very handy for hooking up to a college network and such. They're a steal. :-)

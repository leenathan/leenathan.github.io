And before that, 3 months! Anyway, I wasted HALF of the 4-day weekend doing absolutely nothing at my grandparents' house. We drive down there on Saturday, arrive at 7, sleep, wake up, do boring stuff until 5 on Sunday, and then drive home. What the #@%$% was the point of that trip?????

Oh well. I ran a 18:54 on Saturday. Sherman CC kicks lubricated goat anus!!

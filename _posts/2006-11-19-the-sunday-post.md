1\. Due to the stunning performance and dominating play of the Kitties yesterday, we have a HOME PLAYOFF GAME this coming Saturday! I don't really know how that at large bid came to us, nor do I understand any part of how the hell we're playing at home, but I'm not questioning it. We're playing the Furman Paladins from South Carolina. Aside from having a cool nickname, they suck. But so does everyone else who isn't MSU. Get your student ticket Monday at 8:00 am at the Ticket Office in the fieldhouse, or at the AskUs desk at 10:00 am. $7 apiece. Do it!

2\. I hate French.

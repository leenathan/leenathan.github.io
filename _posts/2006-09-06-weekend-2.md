This weekend Ben, Dave, Leif, Doug, Mark, Megan, and I went to Froze to Death Plateau on the Eastern side of the Beartooth Wilderness for a two day camping trip.

Drove out Saturday around 10:30, started hiking at 1 or 2 - got into a nice camp at 10,500 ft at twilight. Cooked, got cold, slept. Woke up late, ate breakfast, set out to hike Froze to Death Peak and Tempest Peak. View from Tempest was ridiculous.

Headed back to camp, saw mountain goats 20 feet from us, filtered water from a melting ice pack. All in a days work. Slept, early breakfast, down the mountain, swam in a great pool below Mystic Lake, beers and melon at the bottom. Return, sadly, to civilization. I really can't think of words to describe it, despite thinking for hours for a description that would do it justice. It was unbelievable. Most breathtaking camping trip I've ever been on, and I've been on a couple.

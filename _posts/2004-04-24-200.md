Frisbee rocks.

Dead week, on the other hand, does not.

Fortunately, I have enacted the "Lee doesn't play any games until all finals are complete" Plan. That should help in the anti-procrastination department. So, I'll be bustin' the homework this weekend, which includes (but isn't limited to) : a 20 minute music presentation, a 4-8 page paper to accompany the paper, a 6-8 page Texts and Critics paper, a 5 minute Texts and Critics speech, 100 calculus integrals, Physics homework, and studying for a Physics Test.

RA announcement today. I don't feel too nervous, as I will be happy next year as an RA or not.

12 days!

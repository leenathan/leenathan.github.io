Let's see - woke up late, decided breakfast wasn't worth it. Toured the inner 'ring' of Vienna on the tram and then explored more on foot - saw the Opera , Hapsburg Palace, St. Stephen's cathedral (huge, gothic), and others.

We saw a trifecta of museumage this morning: Ephesian ruins, medieval musical instruments, and another one with armor and weapons. Nice! Lunch back at the hostel, and then off to an interesting music museum with cool interactive stuff and the obligatory bits about Mozart, Beethoven, and the lot. We went out to an island on the river to check out a big music festival. It was cool, but being at an event with music you've never heard nor can understand makes things difficult. We checked that box, though.

Tomorrow brings promise of the royal treasure, some football stadiums (woo), and who knows what else.

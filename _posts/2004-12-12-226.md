just finished my last night of rounds for the semester. For those of you not in the know, finals week up here in Mon-tana is next week.

Tuesday = Math 224 and EM 251 (oof) Thursday = Physics 212 (meh) Friday = ChE 213 (I have to get a 25% on this to get an A. cake.)

Then its back to Shertown starting at 6:15 Sunday morning.

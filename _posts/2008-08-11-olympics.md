I've said this before, but I'll say it again. The Olympics are only held every 4 years, because any more often and it it would just be too much awesome to handle. I've forgotten how much I love all of it. The global unity, the national pride, the purity of sport, it's all there. I swear when I hear the NBC Olympic theme I get goosebumps.

The opening ceremony was immense! 2008 people doing Tai Chi, dancers running around a giant globe, the parade of nations, fireworks in the place where they were invented, and the incredible torchlighting. How awesome was that?

I watched swimming prelims last night - races that really meant nothing, but it was so easy to get behind whatever American swimmer was in the water. U-S-A! NBColympics.com has pretty much every second of every event on video; I've been watching rowing prelims, air pistol, fencing, and now a little handball streaming live. The whole not having cable TV really isn't as bad as I thought it would be.

The US men's soccer team has already played two games - beating Japan 1-0 and an agonizing tie to Holland 2-2. With a good performance against Nigeria and some luck, we'll be through to the quarter finals. I expect all of you to be watching on Wednesday morning - catch it live online at 2 am Pacific!

Now excuse me, I need to go watch Michael Phelps dominate the pool.

After a month and change waiting for a graphics card, I finally got fed up and talked to Phil (my cheap GPU source). He hasn't had a very good month, and the mail eats graphics cards, etc etc. Sooooo, after some bargaining that almost nearly got me his x800 xt plat, he decided to reimburse me for the time I have spent waiting for the card. So, Lee gets $100 for nothing. Yes, that is correct. What does Lee do with this money? Buy a Radeon x800 pro. That's right. Tomorrow will be spent in eager anticipation as the amazing GPA dropper makes its way to my mailbox. w00t. Andrew, I don't know what you have, but you can just eat it. :D

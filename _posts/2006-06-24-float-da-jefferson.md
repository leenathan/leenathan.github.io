Jay called me at 10 this morning and told me he was going floating this afternoon.  I have work!  Cliff jumping?  Well... I have an appointment to get a table for the lab at 1... can we go at 1:30?  1:30 rolls around and they're at Big Boys Toys, the tube place.  I haul ass home, get stuff, and head out.  I'm really glad I did, because it was AWESOME.  The river was cool, some good swimming spots, some good fall asleep on the tube spots.  However, about 1/3 of the way through the float, there's a 35-ft rock uplift right on the water, with a really convenient deep spot there as well.  Freefalling for three seconds until you hurtle into water is amazing.  The first time I did it I tried to fly or stabilize myself or something, and got some nice bruises along my arms.  Its really hard to force your arms to stay still while you're falling through the air.  I did it two more times, and then we headed on down the river.  TIm lost his truck keys, so we bummed a ride back upstream and then headed back into the Bozone.  w00t for skipping work.

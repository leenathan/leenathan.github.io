Me and katy slept together last night... :D

went to Travis' house, made a movie sortof. sucked cause Don was stuck at his house being a slave. but we burned stuff on the porch. ha. and killed 1,000 people on The World is Not Enough. At about 400, we decided to see what would happen when you got 4 digits. it wasn't too cool, the game didn't explode or anything. :-(

now we're getting ready for some Christmas get-together or something.

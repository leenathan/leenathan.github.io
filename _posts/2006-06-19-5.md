Saturday night up at Spanish Lakes near Big Sky with Ben, Bovard, Leif, Just Ben, Christina, Travis, and 4 of Travis' friends.  8 miles up, some pretty steep sections, but it was worth the view on top.  Pasta fest for dinner, late breakfast on Sunday morning, and headed back down with Just Ben and the 4 friends later to be back in town for Monday.  Pancakes and Heather's cake delivery later.  Along with an attempt at French.  Out.

I think I shall design or build something really neat and useful one day, and go to audition for American Idol. I don't quite understand why the 'idol' of America has to be a singer, if anyone at all. What the heck can America as a nation look up to a singer for? Why not recognize people who actually contribute to the betterment of society and the world instead of people who have a pretty voice? Sure, they have talent and are well-liked, but they shouldn't be the 'idol' of America. So everyone write a paper about a new idea or draw a new roadmap to peace in the Middle East or cure cancer (Travis) or something helpful and go audition. Or cancel the show. now.

and come to the LAN Party here on Friday night.

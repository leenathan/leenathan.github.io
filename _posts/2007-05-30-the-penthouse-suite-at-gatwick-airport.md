Today started bright and early in Newark - 6 am shuttle to the airport and we were on the plush Virgin Atlantic Airbus A430 to Heathrow.  Me having never been overseas, I was very impressed with the awesome flight - in seat entertainment, attendants always marching around handing out more free food, and the Virgin Atlantic style all was really incredible.  We got into London and promptly started acting like idiot Americans, but eventually found the bus to Gatwick.  After wandering around the airport for a while, we checked in our bags for tomorrow's flight, and are now presently looking for our hotel room (or couch in the airport somewhere, for all you nitpicky types).  The few short hours in England have been brilliant.  The Netherlands awaits!

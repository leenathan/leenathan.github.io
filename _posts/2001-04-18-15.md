Hey everybody,know where the pad is? Okay, the fence that runs north by the pad, all the way out to the track, east over close to the Ag barn and some weird oil/electricity thingy, south to Hwy. 56, and all the west back to the pad is one (1) (uno) property of the school. After school today, Don and I ran 5 of those. hmmm. Lets see. 5 times 1.5 miles apiece equals.... 7.5 miles!!!!! My feet HURT! I did it in 59 minutes (with 3 short stops and one trip inside to pee). 7.627118644 mph. My feet HURT! And its all part of the plan to be superfast for CC next year. Oh boy.

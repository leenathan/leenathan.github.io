Me and Travis made a 95 in AP chem! Go us! OK enough of grades, "They're just stupid numbers." Band was boring, but afterwards, me and Don deserted his mom. It was funny. Cold front coming! no more hot november days (at least for 3 or 4 days)

...and our 2A English Class (The Rice Paddy) is gonna beat Denison's pathetic excuse for a can drive all by ourselves! I hope

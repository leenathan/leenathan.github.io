Why the fuck is there so much importance placed on public polls of how the war is going in Iraq?  It's not like Americans can get any kind of real insight into the situation.  It seems that those polls are just tools to see how well the media outlets are pitching their crap.  Seriously.

I want to be on a soccer team that has $500 billion.  How sick would that be?

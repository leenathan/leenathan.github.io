I tried to go trick-or-treating, but Mr. Internet's door was locked so I didn't get anything from him. Aside from that, here's what you guys gave me:

Don gave me an F-16 kT gave me her computer and a sledgehammer Travis Steel gave me a spare laptop Joseph took my computer Mom gave me brownies Dad gave me an engineering textbook Travis Schaefer gave me his old engineering textbooks, I gave him my Chem book My Chemistry prof gave me the highest exam grade (really, he did. I WIN.) My roomate Ty gave me a cow :D :D And Mother Nature gave me bitter, bitter cold weather. Brrrrrr!

I still need a costume, though.

Happy Halloween!

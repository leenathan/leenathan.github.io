My ballot is being delivered in today’s mail. I am SO excited to get it filled out and returned. After sending thousands of texts to fellow Americans urging them to make a plan and execute their democratic franchise, it seems even more powerful for me to be able to do it myself!

But it can’t end with the ballot. If we want to get this train of a country back on the right track, to a livable future for everyone, we need to keep the pressure on elected officials so they hear the voice of the people. So I’m committing myself to keep advocating for the solutions I want to see our elected officials enact, for reforming our democracy, taking bold action on climate change, and ending systemic racism in our society.

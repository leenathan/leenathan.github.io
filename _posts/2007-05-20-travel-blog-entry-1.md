Here it is - the very first travel blog entry. Ben and I are going to Europe - for 5 weeks. I'll do my best to keep this thing updated. Pictures will more than likely appear after we get back, or through Google or something if we have time while we're over there. First stop is Amsterdam, via London.

Let the countdown to May 30 begin!

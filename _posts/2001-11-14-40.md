dbqs suck. oh wait. so does physics, and english, and everything else. except math. math is all right, being that i'm a math person. dbqs still suck. I understand all of these documents though! Class rings are gonna be cool tomorrow.

physics was the only thing that is worth talking about. today was our usual Mrs. Cowley says we have a test next class so we spend the period working on a study guide (that we have to turn in!!) about the stuff she "taught" to us. yeah right. "Mrs. Cowley, can you tell me how to do, like, all of them???" and so Mrs. Cowley attempts to do them, but only makes it worse by confusing herself even more. yee-ha.

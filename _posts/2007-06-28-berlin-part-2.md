Lazy morning. Headed out to Potsdam to check out the palaces and castles and parks and such. "This is what, 19th century?" That seems young to me, oddly enough. Anyway, the sights were cool, despite the predicted rain coming in bursts through the afternoon. Not as massive as Versailles, but still a neat experience. We didn't pay to go in any of the palaces, either, as that would have put us to sleep.

After Potsdam, we headed into Berlin and caught two museums, the Egyptian and Pergamon (I think) for free with the Thursday afternoon deal. Hooray for free.

Berlin is a sweet city - totally reinventing itself since the wall fell in 89. There are lots of brand new buildings all over town, and other places in construction all the time. A pretty unique situation that makes Berlin one of a kind.

Lee out.

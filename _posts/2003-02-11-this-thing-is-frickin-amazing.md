[a piano for all of you who always wanted one but never had one....](http://download.com.com/3001-2133-10154931.html)

It's the lite version, but I think I found a bug. Open it once, click cancel when it asks you to enter your password and kill the .txt file that pops up. Open it a second time, do the same thing, and the keyboard should be fully enabled (2 octaves, different tones, etc).

I think I'm addicted.

you're hotter.
